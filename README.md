# henry-create-react-app

My own version of [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app). The goal is to generate all the boilerplate necessary for a react app, including configuration and installation of npm dependencies.

Nobody else would probably ever want to do this, but you can actually install it with `npm install henry-create-react-app`. Find it on npm [here](https://www.npmjs.com/package/henry-create-react-app)!
